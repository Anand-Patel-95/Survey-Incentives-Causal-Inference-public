## Contributors:

## Assignment Prompt
We investigate the effect of monetary incentives on survey completion rate through a randomized experiment conducted on a population of University of California, Berkeley graduate students. We assess 3 treatment conditions: 
- No incentive (control)
- Guaranteed $5 reward
- Lottery entry for a $100 reward.

Results are analyzed in R, and the regression tables produced provide causal inference for how specific treatments impact the survey completion rate.
