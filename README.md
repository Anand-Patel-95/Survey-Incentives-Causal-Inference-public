# Increasing Online Survey Completion through Incentives, using a Randomized Experiment 

# Assignment Prompt
We investigate the effect of monetary incentives on survey completion rate through a randomized experiment conducted on a population of University of California, Berkeley graduate students. We assess 3 treatment conditions: no incentive (control), a guaranteed $5 reward, and a lottery entry for a $100 reward.

Results are analyzed in R, and the regression tables produced provide causal inference for how specific treatments impact the survey completion rate.
